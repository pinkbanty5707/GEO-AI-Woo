== Installation ==

1. Upload the `geo-ai-woo` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > GEO AI Woo to configure

The plugin works out of the box with sensible defaults.

== Third-Party Services ==

This plugin optionally connects to external AI services for generating content descriptions. These connections are **disabled by default** and only activate when you explicitly configure an AI provider in Settings > GEO AI Woo > AI Description Generation.

= Anthropic (Claude) =

When you select Claude as your AI provider and click "Generate with AI", the plugin sends your post title and content excerpt to the Anthropic API to generate an AI-optimized description.

* API endpoint: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
* [Anthropic Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/terms)
* [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

= OpenAI =

When you select OpenAI as your AI provider and click "Generate with AI", the plugin sends your post title and content excerpt to the OpenAI API to generate an AI-optimized description.

* API endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
* [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/terms)
* [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)

No data is sent to any external service unless you explicitly enable and configure the AI Description Generation feature. Your API key is stored encrypted in the WordPress database and is never exposed in the admin interface.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is llms.txt? =

llms.txt is a proposed standard that provides AI systems with a structured overview of your site content, similar to how robots.txt works for search engine crawlers.

= Does this plugin require WooCommerce? =

No. WooCommerce integration is optional. The plugin works with standard WordPress posts and pages. WooCommerce features activate automatically when WooCommerce is installed.

= How often is llms.txt regenerated? =

By default, it regenerates daily. You can change this to immediate (on every post save), hourly, or weekly in Settings > GEO AI Woo > Cache Settings.

= Can I exclude specific content from llms.txt? =

Yes. Each post, page, and product has a "GEO AI Woo" meta box where you can check "Exclude from AI indexing". You can also use Quick Edit in list tables for bulk changes.

= Does this plugin work with my SEO plugin? =

Yes. The plugin detects major SEO plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, All in One SEO, SEOPress) and skips JSON-LD schema output to avoid conflicts. Meta tags and HTTP headers work alongside any SEO plugin.

= How are static files generated? =

The plugin writes `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` directly to your WordPress root directory for maximum performance. If the files cannot be written, it falls back to serving content via WordPress rewrite rules.

= Can I hide out-of-stock products from llms.txt? =

Yes. Go to Settings > GEO AI Woo and set the "Out-of-Stock Products" option to "Always hide" or let it follow your WooCommerce visibility settings.

= Can I auto-generate AI descriptions for my content? =

Yes. Go to Settings > GEO AI Woo > AI Description Generation, choose Claude (Anthropic) or OpenAI as your provider, and enter your API key. A "Generate with AI" button will appear in the meta box on each post/page/product. You can also bulk-generate descriptions for all content at once from the settings page.

= Is there a REST API or CLI access? =

Yes. The plugin exposes a REST API at `/wp-json/geo-ai-woo/v1/` with endpoints for reading llms.txt content, checking file status, and triggering regeneration. WP-CLI commands are also available: `wp geo-ai-woo regenerate`, `status`, `export`, and `import`.
